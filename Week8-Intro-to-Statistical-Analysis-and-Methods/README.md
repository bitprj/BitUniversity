# Introduction to NumPy and Statistical Analysis

## Recap
By this point we have looked into some important steps such as:
- Opening a google co-lab notebook.
- Learned Basic Pythob
- Importing libraries such as Pandas.
- Loading datasets (.csv files).
- Observing datasets as pandas DataFrame.
- Learned data visualization with Seaborn

## About the Datasets

### Campus Recruitment
This dataset is a list of recent college graduates at an XYZ university. The key columns include information their major, whether or not they had work experience, whether or not they got recruited by a company, and what their starting salary was.

## Learning Objectives
For this week we willl be focusing on the following goals:
- We will learn the basics about NumPy and its usefulness when working with matrices, tables and higher dimension arrays.
- Understand what statistics is and why it is important
- Perform very basic statistical analysis on sample data
- Learn and perform very basic linear regression modelling to predict salaries of college graduates.

## About the Library
### NumPy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. This makes it a key package when performing large scale statistical or data science analyses.
