    "### What is Pandas?\n",
    "This week, we will cover the basic data manipulation using Pandas.\n",
    "1. Pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool and it is widely used both in academia and industry.\n",
    "2. It is built on top of the Python programming language. \n",
    "3. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data structures in Pandas\n",
    "Pandas provides three data structures: Series, DataFrame, and Panel. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Series is 1-dimensional labelled array and 1-dimensional array represents a single column in excel. It can hold data of **any type** (integer, string, python objects, etc.) and its labels are called indices.\n",
    "2. A DataFrame is 2-dimensional labelled data structure with both rows and columns and 2-dimensional array represents a tabluar data.\n",
    "3. A panel is 3-dimensional. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will focus on DataFrame and we will learn Series in later weeks. We will not cover Panel in this semester, as it's not used as often as two other data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we've covered the fundamentals of Python, it will be fairly easy to pick up Pandas."
