        "Welcome! In this camp, we will be learning the basics of a few programming tools used to analyze data. In today's world, data science is more important than ever. With an increasing amount of data available, data science allows us to sort through data that initially seems not that useful to find meaningful conclusions underneath. In doing so, data science lets us make better, more informed decisions in nearly every aspect of our lives. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, Netflix analyzes watchtimes and user preferences to decide which shows to buy rights for and which shows to recommend to you, health workers analyze virus cases to decide what policies to enact based on their results, stockbrokers analyze stock performance to predict which stocks to buy, etc. The examples are truly endless. \n",
        "\n",
        "Programming allows us to analyze data easily and efficiently. Instead of going through data by hand, we can simply type a few commands and be able to filter out useless data, select specific data we want to examine more in depth, as well as visualize data in just a few seconds. Thus, in this camp, we'll be going over a few of these commonly used data analysis tools and how to use them.  "

        "To begin, we'll be going over the basics of Python, which is a popular general-purpose programming language used for everything from data science to software and web development. Python is one of the best programming languages to learn as a beginner because it is structured to put less emphasis on specific formatting and the commands used are meant to be easily understandable. \n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to data science, Python is particularly useful because it features a variety of data science libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. These libraries are collections of code that aren't built in to standard Python that you can import and then use. For example, instead of having to write many lines of code to make a graph based on data, we can just import the Matplotlib library and use the plot command. \n",
        "\n",

        "Unfortunately, there is no formula to fixing errors or bugs in your code. Some say that debugging (the process of removing bugs and errors in your code) is an art. If so then, as with any art, there is no shortcut to mastery. Despite this, there are a few tools to deal with errors effectively:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "- **Experience** - This will probably be your most useful tool when dealing with errors. After you have been programming for some time, you'll start to notice some of the same errors show up again and again in your code. As such, knowing what you did to fix them last time is irreplacable in quickly dealing with problems now.\r\n",
        "- **Manual Detection** - Like we mentioned before, the error statement always tells you where the error occurred and sometimes even clearly reveals what the problem was. In this case, you can simply go back to that part of the code and try to see if the solution quickly presents itself to you. If not, it might even be worth going through your code line by line, ensuring that everything is working exactly the way you want. Remember - *the computer only does what you  tell it to do, not what you **think** you're telling it to do*.\r\n",
        "- **Google** - There is a saying among programmers - \"Google is your best friend\", and we can't understate how true that is. Many times, you'll come across an error that you simply have no idea how to deal with. As such, Googling the error is the best course of action. It is *almost guaranteed* that someone else got that error before you, asked a question about it on a forum, and received an answer from other programmers. Those answers are therefore freely available to you and your best bet in fixing an error when all else fails. \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Many beginners in programming are hesitant to Google something when they're stuck. They feel like it's cheating, or an act of giving up somehow. **Please don't feel this way.** There is no harm in asking for help when you need it, and not taking advantage of the greater programming community's knowledge base will only cause you unnecessary headaches down the road. This doesn't just apply to errors, but to everything else regarding code as well. You're not giving up, just utilizing the experiences of those who came before you."

As such, don't think you've failed whenever you get errors in your code. You'll never escape them. What matters is that you take a step back, regroup, and focus on figuring out the solution. \r\n",
        "\r\n",

If you wrote code that ran perfectly every time, you won't improve, learn anything new, or build any resilience in tackling challenges or solving problems. Hopefully this discussion ensures that you won't stop dead in your tracks next time you see an error in your code. Rather, you'll have everything you need to push through.
