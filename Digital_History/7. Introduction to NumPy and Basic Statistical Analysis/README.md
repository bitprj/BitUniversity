# Introduction to NumPy and Statistical Analysis

## Recap
By this point we have looked into some important steps such as:
- Opening a google co-lab notebook.
- Learning Basic Python
- Importing libraries such as Pandas.
- Loading datasets (.csv files).
- Observing datasets as a pandas DataFrame.
- Learning data visualization with Seaborn

## About the Datasets

### Campus Recruitment
This dataset is a list of recent college graduates at an XYZ university. The key columns include information about their major, whether or not they had work experience, whether or not they got recruited by a company, and what their starting salary was.

## Learning Objectives
For this week we willl be focusing on the following goals:
- Learn the basics about NumPy and its usefulness when working with matrices, tables, and higher dimension arrays.
- Understand what statistics is and why it is important
- Perform basic statistical analysis on sample data
- Learn and perform linear regression modeling to predict the salaries of college graduates.

## About the Library
### NumPy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. This makes it a key package when performing large scale statistical or data science analyses.
